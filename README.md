## Study the Sub-nanometer Fluctuations in Single Cells Using a Plasmonic Imaging Technique

Abstract:

Plasma membrane of live cells undergo active membrane fluctuations. Scrupulous study of single cell
membrane fluctuations can provide better insight into the physiological processes like metabolism,
mitosis and cell motility which are very important while developing drug assays for diseases like
cancer. Therefore, it is crucial to study the localized membrane fluctuations which pose a technical
challenge due to their small yet swift movement. Here, a plasmonic microscope has been used to study
membrane fluctuations in HeLa cancer cells. Sub-nanometer level membrane movement has been imaged
with a spatial resolution of 0.5 μm in real time. A study of membrane fluctuation amplitude is made
to discuss about active membrane movement, cell heterogeneity and interdependence of different cell
regions within a single cell. These results could be helpful to study the cell’s mechanoresponse, its
viscoelastic properties and analyze the activity of biomarkers when cancer cells are exposed to
different drug treatments.
